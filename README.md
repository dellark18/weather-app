Day 1 Project: Global Weather Watcher App

Description: This global Weather Watcher application is a simple web application designed to provide users with up-to-date weather conditions from across the globe. Users get to stay informed about weather patterns and forecasts.

I built this project with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and OPEN WEATHER API.
