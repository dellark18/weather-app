30 Days Javascript Coding Challenge.

Day 1 Project: Global Weather Watcher App. You can access the weather app via this link; https://weathermetro.netlify.app/ 

Description: This global Weather Watcher application is a simple web application designed to provide users with up-to-date weather conditions from across the globe. Users get to stay informed about weather patterns and forecasts.

I built this project with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and OPEN WEATHER API.
